# Diabetes-Milletus-Prediction

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the worldâ€™s diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes. There is no doubt that this alarming figure needs great attention. With the rapid development of machine learning, machine learning has been applied to many aspects of medical health for accurate predictions.

Solution:
The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that can efficiently discover the rules to predict the risk level of patients based on the given parameter about their health (In this project, we can use decision tree, random forest and neural network to predict diabetes mellitus). Then we evaluate the performance of the model in terms of different parameter like classification accuracy AUC-ROC Curves.
An android application is built from where the patient health features are entered and depending on the entered parameters, the machine learning model integrated to application will predict the type of diabetes and according to the type of diabetes diet plan for the person will be displayed on the UI
